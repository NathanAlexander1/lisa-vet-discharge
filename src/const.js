Be careful when exposing your puppy to other dogs - make sure the other dogs are well behaved and fully vaccinated. We recommend avoiding dog parks or other highly trafficked areas until your puppy is fully vaccinated. https://www.edmontonhumanesociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fear-Free-Puppy-Socialization-Bingo.pdf\nYou can also look into some YouTube videos made by 'kikopup'. They have very good free videos available explaining how to use positive reinforcement training with your puppy, such as teaching handling skills, how to remain calm, how to play appropriately and more. Any resources from Sophia Yin or other positive reinforcement trainers should be helpful as well. You can find a collection of videos here: https://www.youtube.com/@kikopup\nAnother good training source can be found at this website: ttps://www.fearfreehappyhomes.com/\nWe recommend trying to train your puppy to tolerate having their mouth, ears, face and feet touched. This will help in the future when your puppy will need veterinary exams and/or grooming services. You can do this by pairing treats with a brief touch of the mouth and slowly increasing the length of the touch until you can lift your puppy's lips and look into their mouth. You can do this for his feet, nails, ears etc. as well.\nRegarding play-biting, it is important not to let this happen with anyone in the home (or any human your puppy interacts with). Biting and mouthing is a common way that dogs interact with one another, but it should not be done with humans. Making sure to be consistent to stop playing whenever play biting starts and to redirect your puppy to playing and biting an appropriate toy will eventually result in a preference to biting toys rather than human hands.\nSeattle Humane also offers a variety of puppy play and dog training classes.

Unfortunately Seattle Humane does not provide diagnostics prior to or following surgery to determine if cardiac disease is present. Seattle Humane is a high quality, high volume spay neuter facility that uses a standardized drug protocol and does not have the ability to tailor anesthetic plans for specific patients. Seattle Humane also does not provide intra-operative blood pressure, ECG, or other advanced anesthetic monitoring. In addition to the standard risks of surgery, performing a spay or neuter on an animal with cardiac disease carries a higher risk of complications, including intra-operative hypotension (low blood pressure - prolonged hypotension can lead to organ damage), arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm), congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest and death. If you are concerned, follow up with a full service or primary care veterinarian is recommended to discuss available additional diagnostics (cardiology referral, x-rays, ECG, etc.) to evaluate for underlying cardiac disease including the associated anesthetic risks or if you are seeking tailored drug protocols or full anesthetic monitoring.
