Be careful when exposing your puppy to other dogs - make sure the other dogs are well behaved and fully vaccinated. We recommend avoiding dog parks or other highly trafficked areas until your puppy is fully vaccinated. https://www.edmontonhumanesociety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fear-Free-Puppy-Socialization-Bingo.pdf\nYou can also look into some YouTube videos made by 'kikopup'. They have very good free videos available explaining how to use positive reinforcement training with your puppy, such as teaching handling skills, how to remain calm, how to play appropriately and more. Any resources from Sophia Yin or other positive reinforcement trainers should be helpful as well. You can find a collection of videos here: https://www.youtube.com/@kikopup\nAnother good training source can be found at this website: ttps://www.fearfreehappyhomes.com/\nWe recommend trying to train your puppy to tolerate having their mouth, ears, face and feet touched. This will help in the future when your puppy will need veterinary exams and/or grooming services. You can do this by pairing treats with a brief touch of the mouth and slowly increasing the length of the touch until you can lift your puppy's lips and look into their mouth. You can do this for hisHer feet, nails, ears etc. as well.\nRegarding play-biting, it is important not to let this happen with anyone in the home (or any human your puppy interacts with). Biting and mouthing is a common way that dogs interact with one another, but it should not be done with humans. Making sure to be consistent to stop playing whenever play biting starts and to redirect your puppy to playing and biting an appropriate toy will eventually result in a preference to biting toys rather than human hands.\nSeattle Humane also offers a variety of puppy play and dog training classes.

    abnormalityBlurb: "Allergies (dog)",
    domBlurb:
      "<p>As we discussed, allergies can be a potential underlying cause of skin and ear issues in dogs. Allergies are a hypersensitivity of the immune system to a particular allergen, and often present in pets as skin and ear problems. Though there are a variety of presentations, this is most commonly seen as redness and itching, rash, ear infections and over-grooming with hair loss. The three major types of allergies in pets are flea allergy, food allergy and atopic dermatitis (environmental allergies). We recommend continuing petName on a regular monthly flea preventative, administered once every 30 days. We have Bravecto available through the wellness clinic, or you can place a flea treatment order through Chewy.com or other similar online pet pharmacies. Unfortunately we are a limited service wellness clinic and are unable to manage the treatment of allergies long term. We recommend following up with a full service veterinarian for additional diagnostic and treatment options, including symptomatic drug therapy to help reduce itching (e.g. antihistamines, steroids, immunosuppressive drugs), medicated baths, prescription diet trials and allergy testing & immunotherapy. Below are a few beginning tips that you can try.</p><p>We try to manage allergies on a few fronts, due to many common causes for allergies:<p>1. Fleas - please make sure to keep your dog (and the rest of the animals in the home) up to date on flea prevention medication. Dogs that are sensitive to fleas can develop a serious skin reaction with even just a single flea bite.</p><p>2. Food - food could also be a potential cause for your dog’s allergies. The most common food allergy dogs have is related to chicken. Doing a diet trial that eliminates chicken from the diet for at least 4-6 weeks would help you evaluate whether or not a chicken allergy is connected to their itchiness and skin issues. This includes snacks and treats. A fish based diet may be helpful to start with. If this doesn’t help, your dog may eventually need to be placed on a prescription hypoallergenic diet through a full service clinic.</p><p>3. Environmental allergies - This is the most broad category, and can include dust mite allergies, grass and pollen allergies and anything outdoors. Since we can't shut dogs inside in a bubble, these are the allergies we try to manage with weekly (or once every two weeks) bathing and ear cleaning if they also have itchy ears related to allergies as well. When choosing an ear cleaner, you can choose one that has antifungal and antibacterial components. In the clinic, we use Dechra TrizUltra+Keto ear flush. We recommend that you stay away from any homemade ear cleaners or anything with essential oils, as these can be very irritating to the ears.</p></p>",

In the meantime, you can try adding a daily probiotic supplement to hisHer diet such as Proviable or Purina Fortiflora for Cats, or slowly changing hisHer food to a diet formulated for sensitive stomachs like Hill's Perfect Digestion 7+</p>",

    domBlurb:
      "<p>As discussed, we recommend monitoring petName's weight. As adults, pets tend to put on weight more easily, especially after they've been spayed or neutered. Continued weight gain may put your pet at risk for developing health issues such as arthritis and diabetes. Fortunately, losing weight can help reduce that risk and even reverse some of the effects of these conditions. Ideally a weight loss plan should be managed by a full service clinic since it must be done slowly in order to avoid possible metabolic complications that can arise with rapid reduction in calories. In addition, regular monitoring of body weight and body condition score is important for successful weight management. A healthy rate of weight loss in cats is no more than 0.5%-1% of body weight per week. Weight loss should always be done incrementally (slowly over time). Below are some tips for weight loss:</p><p>1. Adjusting the ratio of wet food to dry food offered. Wet food is usually less calorically dense and can also help cats feel a bit more full because of the added water content. Therefore, replacing some dry food with wet food instead can sometimes help with satiety and weight loss.</p><p>2.Changing food to an 'indoor cat' diet or even a 'weight loss' diet.</p><p>3. Multiple planned playtimes that encourage your cat run around for about 10 minutes a few times a day is great! Changing around between cat toys keeps things interesting, and regular play time can help strengthen your bond.</p><p>4. Slow feeding - you can do this by feeding your cat from toys, puzzle bowls or from a big, wide plate. You can even flip a standard food bowl upside down and use it that way. Throwing kibble one by one on the floor can double as an interactive feeding game and slow feeding.</p><p>5. Using an automatic feeder can help measure food, and a regular feeding schedule may help cats to stop begging for food.</p><p>6. Instead of free feeding, measure out the amount of food you are planning to give in one day and slowly provide small meals from this amount throughout the day.</p>",

      "<p>Finally, we recommend monitoring petName's weight. Continued weight gain may put your pet at risk for developing health issues such as arthritis and diabetes. Fortunately, losing weight can help these patients reduce that risk and even reverse some of the effects of these conditions. Weight loss must occur slowly over time and should ideally be monitored by a full service veterinarian. Regular monitoring of body weight and body condition score is important for successful weight management. A healthy rate of weight loss in dogs is 1%-2% of body weight per week. If your dog is older and has already been on a strict diet for a while but is still gaining or not losing weight, blood work may be recommended to evaluate your dog for other possible causes for weight gain such as hormonal abnormalities. Included below are some weight loss tips for dogs:</p><p>1. Evaluate how much you are feeding exactly, then cut this by approximately 10% every week until you get to the desired amount.</p><p>2. Consider changing your dog to a 'weight loss' diet.</p><p>3. Increasing the number or length of walks.</p><p>4. More activated playtime including playing with a ball, a new toy, teaching your dog new tricks etc.</p><p>5. Feeding more slowly, such as feeding from toys, puzzle feeders or from a big wide plate. You can even flip the food bowl upside down and use it that way. Throwing your pet's kibble one by on the floor can also double as an interactive feeding game as well as slow feeding.</p><p>6. Choosing healthier lower calorie treats. For example, green beans added to food (with no added sugar or salt) can be great.</p>",

If you are planning to allow petName to have kittens at home, we recommend creating a nesting box within a quiet, confined space away from other pets and heavy foot traffic in your home. Queens are generally able to give birth and care for newborn kittens with little assistance, but occasionally dystocia or difficulty in passing a fetus through the pelvic canal can occur. Signs of this include:</p><p>- Prolonged interval between the birth of kittens (i.e. >4-6 hrs)</p><p>- 20 mins of intense labor without producing a kitten</p><p>- Fetal membranes or part of the fetus protruding from the vagina for >15 minutes without progress</p><p>- Acute depression</p><p>- Presence of green discharge without the production of a fetus within 15 minutes</p><p>- Presence of fresh blood for more than 10 minutes.</p><p>Please see the following website for more information about dystocia - <a href='https://veterinarypartner.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=19239&id=4951324' target='_blank'>https://veterinarypartner.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=19239&id=4951324</a></p><p>Additional information about caring for a nursing queen and neonatal kittens at home can be found at the following website: https://www.kittenlady.org/mama. It is important to closely monitor the kittens’ progress to ensure intervention is not indicated. Kittens should be bright and alert, able to nurse, kept warm and gain weight steadily. If you are at all concerned about the kittens, we recommend following up with a full service or urgent care veterinarian for further evaluation. Locating the closest emergency facility and/or follow up with a full service veterinarian to discuss a plan for petName’s queening is also commended.</p><p>Thank you again for bringing petName to Seattle Humane.

      "<p>petName has had evidence of gastrointestinal worms at home. petName received an oral deworming medication that will treat for roundworms and hookworms. Please give the second dose of dewormer by mouth in 14 days, as instructed on the label. Roundworms and hookworms are two of the most common gastrointestinal parasites found in companion animals. In addition, we also administered an injection called Praziquantel to treat for tapeworms. Tapeworms are segmented intestinal parasites of cats and dogs. They belong to a different family than other intestinal parasites (such as hookworms and roundworms) and therefore are not treated by our standard dewormer. In order to complete its life cycle, a tapeworm egg must be ingested by a flea larva (an immature stage of the flea). Once inside the larval flea, the tapeworm egg develops as the larval flea matures into an adult flea. During grooming, or in response to a flea bite, cats and dogs can inadvertently swallow the flea. As the flea is digested, the tapeworm egg is released, hatches, and then anchors itself to the intestinal lining, therefore completing the lifecycle. Tapeworms therefore must first pass through the flea (the intermediate host) before they can infect the cat or dog, and this is why fleas and tapeworm segments are often found together on an exam or in the home. Additional information can be found at the following website: <a href='https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/tapeworm-infection-in-cats' target='_blank'>https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/tapeworm-infection-in-cats</a>.
